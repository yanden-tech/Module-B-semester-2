    "By the way: why didn't I ask the question \"how can I check whether the customers all have unique AccountIDs\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem would be that Google and ChatGPT don't know what \"customers\" you are talking about.  It's important to understand that the AccountIDs are a column of a DataFrame, and as such they are a Series.  Therefore, we should use the correct vocabulary and ask about a Series.  If you mess up and ask about a \"list\" instead of a Series, you _might_ get an answer that still works.  But it's better to get the vocabularly right.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to add \"in python\" because this task could be performed in many languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT gave me this suggestion: data[data.isin(data[data.duplicated()])].iloc[0]\n",
    "However, ChatGPT did not explain how this code worked and even claimed (falsely) that it was going to use the value_counts() function in the solution.  So although the code is correct, I personally found ChatGPT's answer very confusing.  You could, perhaps, ask ChatGPT to explain further how this code works.\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT, \"How does this code work: data[data.isin(data[data.duplicated()])].iloc[0]\"\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Google leads me to the documentation for the duplicated() function:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Series.duplicated.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I can see that when I really need is data.duplicated(keep = False), where \"data\" should be the Series in question.  However, this just gives me a Series of boolean values indicating which ones are duplicates.  I have to somehow know that extracting the numerical values instead of a Series of booleans involves boolean indexing: data\\[data.duplicated(keep = False)].\n",
