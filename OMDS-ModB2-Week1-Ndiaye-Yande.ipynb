    "The problem would be that Google and ChatGPT don't know what \"customers\" you are talking about.  It's important to understand that the AccountIDs are a column of a DataFrame, and as such they are a Series.  Therefore, we should use the correct vocabulary and ask about a Series.  If you mess up and ask about a \"list\" instead of a Series, you _might_ get an answer that still works.  But it's better to get the vocabularly right.\n",

So although the code is correct, I personally found ChatGPT's answer very confusing.  You could, perhaps, ask ChatGPT to explain further how this code works.\n",

    "Here, I can see that when I really need is data.duplicated(keep = False), where \"data\" should be the Series in question.  However, this just gives me a Series of boolean values indicating which ones are duplicates.
